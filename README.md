# Self-Driving-Car-in-UdaCity
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to control the steering of a simulated self-driving car using camera images. Built using Python and TensorFlow/Keras, the model is trained on driving data collected from the Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator.

The pipeline includes image preprocessing (resizing, normalization, color space transformation), data augmentation, model creation inspired by NVIDIAâ€™s end-to-end architecture, and model training using Mean Squared Error loss. The output is a trained model capable of predicting steering angles in real-time based on visual input.

This project demonstrates a foundational step in behavioral cloning for autonomous vehicle control.
